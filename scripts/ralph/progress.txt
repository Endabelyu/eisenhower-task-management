# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-02-22
Feature: Eisenhower Matrix - Complete Missing Features
Parent Task: 1

## Codebase Patterns
- React + Vite + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- State management: React Context + custom hooks (useTasks), persisted to localStorage
- Routing: react-router-dom v6 with BrowserRouter
- Drag-and-drop: @dnd-kit/core + @dnd-kit/sortable
- UI components: shadcn/ui (Radix-based) in src/components/ui/
- Task types: src/types/task.ts (Task, TaskWithMetrics, Quadrant, QUADRANT_CONFIG)
- Context: src/context/TaskContext.tsx wraps useTasks hook
- Pages follow pattern: max-w container, icon + heading, muted description
- Dark mode: CSS variables in index.css (.dark class), tailwind darkMode: ["class"]
- next-themes is installed but not yet used
- recharts is installed but not yet used
- sonner toast is rendered in App.tsx but never triggered
- AlertDialog component available at src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx
- Tests: vitest + @testing-library/react, setup in src/test/setup.ts
